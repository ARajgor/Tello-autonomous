## Introduction

This is multi-tasking autonomous drone project. Main objective is to transfer all the compute intensive tasks to the computer/cloud.


### Status of the project

This project is developed in 2021 and since then it's been not updated. 
currently I'm working on some other projects.

The approach I used may not efficient and better models are available now. 
You can do this entire project using google mediapipe library. 
it's very easy to use and efficient.
